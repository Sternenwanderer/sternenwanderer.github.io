Many of us know the Greek myths, and many of us have noticed how their female voices often remain silent â€“ and we have seen the efforts of those who attempt to give them a voice.

Thread is a play that asks questions: about identity, about womanhood, about heroes and icons, and about how we engage with our old stories.
